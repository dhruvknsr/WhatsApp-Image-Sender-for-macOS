# WhatsApp-Image-Sender-for-macOS
This Python script automates sending all images (JPEG/PNG) from a specified folder to a WhatsApp group via the WhatsApp Desktop app on macOS. It uses PyAutoGUI for GUI interactions, AppleScript for app control, and supports headless setups (e.g., Mac Mini) with a dummy HDMI plug.
